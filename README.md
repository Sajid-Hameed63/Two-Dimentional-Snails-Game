# Two-Dimentional-Snails-Game
Game development is very fascinating aspect of Computer Science world. It
has many challenges on its path which makes it very interesting to work on.
Nowadays AI based game are being developed on a large scale. These games
help human to become expert after practicing on it. In this project, We made a
"Snails" game in which there are two versions of game. One of them is "Human
to Human" and other one is "Human to AI agent". Our major challenge was to
provide user a good GUI and make the character (AI based) more intelligent.
We used Arcade module ad Python in this project. We used the strategy that
player occupying more spaces will be the winner.
